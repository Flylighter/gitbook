With Insiders, you gain access to an unlimited number of destination accounts. In Notion terms, this means multiple Workspaces.&#x20;

### Default Account

In Settings > Flows, you can set a default account to be used when creating a new Flow.

### Other Destinations

In the future, Flylighter will support other destinations such as Obsidian, custom HTTP requests, and more. The appearance of Flows may change depending on the type of the selected account.
