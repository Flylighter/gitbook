# Resetting the Extension

Resetting the extension may be necessary to resolve certain issues.&#x20;

When you reset the extension, you'll erase all local user data. Beforehand, you should **download a copy of your data**. For more info on downloading your user data see [Export and Import Your Data](../in-depth/export-and-import-your-data.md).

Resetting the extension does not effect synced data, so upon logging in after resetting, all your synced Flows, history, and settings will sync.

## Chrome & Chromium-based browsers

Right-click the Flylighter icon in your toolbar, or click the Extensions icon, then click the  ••• button next to Flylighter. Next, click **Options.**

Click **Download User Data** in order to download an encrypted backup file of your local data.

Next, click **Reset Extenstion.** After you do so, the Options page will close. Any page that was previously open may need to be refreshed before Flylighter will open on it.

Once you've reset the extension, refresh your browser tab to activate Flylighter once again. From there, you can log back into your user account.

After you've logged in, you have a couple of options for restoring your data:

1. If you're on the Pro plan or Insiders plan, your data will automatically sync back to the extension. Easy!
2. Alternatively, you can go back to the Extension Options page and clikc **Restore from Backup.** You must be logged into your account to do this.
