# How to Check for Errors

We do our best to ship quality software, but bugs happen! When something weird happens, you can [let us know in our Discord](https://discord.gg/tptj5ZVzyc).

Before you do, here's how you can check for errors, as well as make sure your extension is up-to-date.

## Checking the Console for Errors

If Flylighter is doing something unexpected, it may have hit an error. While we may be able to see this error in [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) (if you've opted-in to sharing anonymous analytics), it will still be helpful if you share any errors with us when reporting bugs.

To check for errors:

1. Right-click anywhere in Flylighter ‚Üí click Inspect.
2. Click the Console tab in the Developer Tools panel that comes up.
3. Check for any errors with red backgrounds.

If you can take a screenshot that looks roughly like the one below, sharing that along with your bug report will be incredibly helpful! üôè

## Checking Flylighter's Version

If you're running into a bug, it's possible that you're on an old version of Flylighter. We might have even fixed the bug you're experiencing in the latest version.

Browser extensions don't automatically update until you close and re-open your browser, so if you tend to leave your browser open for days or weeks (like I do), then you might be running an out-of-date version.

Here's how to check.

1. Open Flylighter and click the `?` icon.
2. Check the version number listed in the top right corner of the What's New card.

Finally, you can check to see if the current version listed in the Web Store matches the version you have.

If you're running an earlier version, you can update simply by fully closing and re-opening your browser. If you're a MacOS user, remember that you need to fully quit the browser with `‚åò + q`, rather than just closing the window.
