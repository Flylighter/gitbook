## Database Capture

Database capture is the default mode for Flows. Each capture is added as a new page in a database.

## Page Capture

Page capture allows you to capture to a specific page, and to Flow editor will only show the page content editor in this mode, more on the page content editor in the next article.. All captured data is appended to the end of the page.

When you switch a flow to page capture mode, you will be given the option of selecting an existing page in the selected database.
