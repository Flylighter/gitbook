# Export and Import Your Data

At any time, you can export your user data from Flylighter and save it to your computer. You might want to do this on order to port your data to another browser or device, or just to back it up.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Go Hassle-Free:** When you upgrade to Flylighter Pro, you get effortless, near-real-time Sync for your Flow settings and Capture History. You can upgrade to Pro from the Settings tab of the Flylighter extension. If you choose to do, thank you for your support!
{% endhint %}

Your user data file contains everything needed to restore Flylighter to its current state in another browser or computer, including:

* Flows and their settings
* Capture History (limited to the last 10 items on the Free plan)
* General Flylighter settings

Note that Flylighter is a **capture** tool, so we don't store the content of your captures beyond the rough details needed to maintain your Capture History (page title, URL, Notion page URL, capture time, and the Flow you used).

The rest of what you captured â€“ e.g. a full article or set of highlights \* is safe in the destination you configured in your Flow. That's where it belongs; we don't want to keep or store your data!

## Export Your Data

To export your user data file, right-click the Flylighter icon in your browser's toolbar and click **Extension Options.**

In the options screen, click **Download User Data**.

## Import a Backup File

From the same **Options** page, click the **Restore from Backup** button and find your downloaded `.fly` file.

**Note:** You'll need to be logged into your Flylighter account in order to restore your downloaded backup file.
