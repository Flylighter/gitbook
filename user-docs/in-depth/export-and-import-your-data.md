# Export and Import Your Data

At any time, you can export your user data from Flylighter and save it to your computer. You might want to do this on order to port your data to another browser or device, or just to back it up.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Coming Soon:** Flylighter Pro will have effortless, near-real-time Sync for your Flow settings and Capture History. When we launch Sync, you'll still be able to export your data manually on the Free Plan using the process in this article.
{% endhint %}

Your user data file contains everything needed to restore Flylighter to its current state in another browser or computer, including:&#x20;

* Flows and their settings
* Capture History (limited to the last 10 items on the Free plan)
* General Flylighter settings

Note that Flylighter is a **capture** tool, so we don't store the content of your captures beyond the rough details needed to maintain your Capture History (page title, URL, Notion page URL, capture time, and the Flow you used).

The rest of what you captured â€“ e.g. a full article or set of highlights * is safe in the destination you configured in your Flow. That's where it belongs; we don't want to keep or store your data!

## Export Your Data

To export your user data file, right-click the Flylighter icon in your browser's toolbar and click **Extension Options.**

In the options screen, click **Download User Data**.
