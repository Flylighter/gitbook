The Advanced Data Plugin allows you to use a combination of CSS selectors and regular expressions to extract content from a web page in a predictable and repeatable way.

***

## Using Advanced Data

Advanced Data items can be found in the data picker dropdown.  Here you can pick selectors that are marked for all sites, and those that are for the current host name. These behave the same as the Basic Data items and can be saved for auto-fill.

## Creating Advanced Data

To create a new selector, click the **+New** button on the toggle for either This Site, or All Sites. Here you can give the new selector a name, as well as the CSS selector to use, along with a real-time preview. Additionally, if the result from the CSS selector is text. you can add a regular expression to further hone the result.
