# Updating Flylighter Manually

Browser extensions should usually update automatically when you restart your web browser â€“ i.e. close and re-open it.

Alternatively, you can update them manually without restarting the browser. Here's how you can do that.

If your browser's current version of Flylighter is **0.11.30\_public or higher**, you'll see a notification when you open the extension when a new version is available. Simply click **Reload Extension** to upgrade to the latest version.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint:** You can see which version of Flylighter you have installed by clicking the **Help** button in the bottom-right corner of the extension. See [#how-to-check-flylighters-version](updating-flylighter-manually.md#how-to-check-flylighters-version "mention") below for more details.
{% endhint %}

You can also update the extension directly from your browser's **Extensions** page.

Click the puzzle piece icon in your browser's toolbar, next to any visible extensions. Then click **Manage Extensions.**

Find the **Developer Mode** option and toggle it **on.** Finally, find and click the **Update** button. This will update _all_ extensions to the latest version.

## How to Check Flylighter's Version

In our [Changelog](../about-flylighter/changelog.md), we note the version of each new release.

You can check that your extension is up-to-date by opening Flylighter, clicking the `/` icon, and checking the version number.
