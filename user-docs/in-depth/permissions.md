# Permissions

Flylighter has access to all sites by default, however you can manually change this permission to "On Clicked" if you prefer. However setting permissions this way does prevent the following features from working correctly:

* Keyboard shortcuts to open Flylighter/Flows
* Context menu shortcuts when Flylighter is closed
* Sidebar mode
* Persistent highlights
