# Persistent Highlights

{% hint style="warning" %}
Work in progress
{% endhint %}

Highlights you take with Flylighter persist indefinitely, across page refreshes, sessions, and even across devices with Sync.&#x20;

### Taking a Highlight

When you take a highlight using the context menu or the keyboard shortcut \
(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>(Mac)/<kbd>Alt</kbd>(Win) + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> by default) that highlight will be automatically added to the page content of your currently opened Flow, or the first Flow you open.

After capturing a highlight, a visual highlight will appear on the page along with a small menu that links back to the capture.

This highlight will appear anytime you visit this page in the future.
