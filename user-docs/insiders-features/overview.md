# Insiders Overview

Flylighter Insiders is our Pro plan for early adopters who want to support development and tryout the latest features. These are the features you can currently expect when joining Insiders:

* [**Sync**](https://docs.flylighter.com/insiders-features/sync) - Keep your Flows, highlights, and capture history with you on any computer or browser.
* [**Persistent Highlights**](https://docs.flylighter.com/insiders-features/persistent-highlights) - Highlight the web, permanently. Highlights persist on web pages across refreshes, sessions, and devices.
* [**Unlimited Capture History**](https://docs.flylighter.com/insiders-features/unlimited-capture-history) - See all captures youâ€™ve made, and easily append to them
* [**Unlimited Workspaces/Accounts**](https://docs.flylighter.com/insiders-features/multiple-workspaces-accounts) - Add unlimited Notion workspaces and other destinations like Obsidian, web hooks, and more as they become available.
* **Early access to new features**
* **Insiders Discord Channel**

In the future, we will be introducing a more standard Pro Plan without early access to features or the discord group.
