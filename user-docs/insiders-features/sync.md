Sync lets you take your Flows, settings, highlights, and custom CSS selectors with you to other devices and browsers.

### How to use Sync

Sync is automatic. When Flylighter is opened you will get a notification at the bottom of the extension to indicate sync is occurring. When Flylighter closes, all changes you made in that session will be synced to your account in the background.

### Gotchas

Being that sync only triggers when you open and close Flylighter, rapidly switching between browsers and devices or failing to close an instance of Flylighter can cause conflicts. When conflicts happen, the more recently changed data is always preferred.

We have plans to improve this very soon, but it's worth being aware of at the present time.
