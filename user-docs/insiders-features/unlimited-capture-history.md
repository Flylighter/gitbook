# Unlimited Capture History

Insiders gives you an unlimited capture history, all of which you can append to. This feature is retroactive when you subscribe to Insiders, so all your captures when you were using the free plan become available.

### History Tab

Under the **History** tab in the main view, you can view all the captures you've made, including a link the site you were on, a link to the captured content, and the option to append new content to the original.

### Append Capture

When you choose to append to a previous capture, Flylighter opens to the Content Editor in what is essentially a single-use Flow. Here you can add new content. All content will always be appended to the bottom of the existing page.
