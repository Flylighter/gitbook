# Zen

Flylighter is compatible with the [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/) browser.

Since Zen is built on the same foundational browser technology as [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/), it has the same limitations you'll find in Firefox. Namely, it _only_ supports Sidebar Mode. You won't be able to open Flylighter as an in-page popup like you can in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, etc.).

On this page, you'll find answers to Zen-specific questions.

## Pin Flylighter to the Extensions Bar

In Zen, extensions don't pin themselves to your toolbar by default.

To pin Flylighter to the Zen toolbar, do the following:

1. Click the Extensions icon within the address bar.
2. Right-click the Flylighter icon.
3. Click Pin to Toolbar.

After you've done this, you should see the Flylighter icon next to your Search bar.
