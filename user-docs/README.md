# What is Flylighter?

Flylighter is a **fast, hyper-flexible web clipper for Notion.**

You can use Flylighter's browser extensions for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other browsers to capture nearly any web content to your Notion workspace:

* Web pages
* Full articles
* Highlights and text snippets (with links and formatting!)
* Annotations
* Tables
* Images
* Complex HTML content

By creating **Flows,** you can create near-instant workflows that let you capture any of the above content to a **database** or **page** in your Notion workspace.

In Flows that capture to Notion databases, you can also set the exact property values that you want. Set them automatically using dynamic web data or rules, or choose them individually on each capture.

Flylighter will also let you capture **multiple** highlights and web elements to Notion pages and database properties, and can also **append** new highlights and notes to previously-capture pages.
