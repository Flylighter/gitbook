# What is Flylighter?

Flylighter is a **fast, hyper-flexible web clipper for Notion.**

You can use Flylighter's browser extensions for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and other browsers to capture nearly any web content to your Notion workspace:

* Web pages
* Full articles
* Highlights and text snippets (with links and formatting!)
* Annotations
* Tables
* Images
* Screenshots
* Complex HTML content

By creating **Flows,** you can create near-instant workflows that let you capture any of the above content to a **database** or **page** in your Notion workspace.

In Flows that capture to Notion databases, you can also set the exact property values that you want. Set them automatically using dynamic web data or rules, or choose them individually on each capture.

Flylighter will also let you capture **multiple** highlights and web elements to Notion pages and database properties, and can also **append** new highlights and notes to previously-capture pages.

You can go even further with Flylighter's **Sidebar mode,** which allows you to capture content from _multiple tabs,_ and to navigate to new pages in the same tab to capture more information without closing the extension.

Finally, Flylighter respects your privacy by using the official Notion API for captures, which means you can [customize the extension's permissions](in-depth/permissions.md) and prevent it from seeing web content until you activate it. Other Notion web clippers use unofficial capture methods that Notion has asked developers not to use; these web clippers require full access to your Notion workspace and act at _you,_ rather than as a properly-scoped bot user.
