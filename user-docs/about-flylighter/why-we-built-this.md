# Why We Built This

We built Flylighter because we wanted better tools for **capturing ideas, resources, and new information.**

Steve Jobs once said:

> "**Creativity is just connecting things.** When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things."

When you have better tools for capturing your ideas and the information you come across, **the more you'll capture and the less you'll lose.**

Our core idea is that when you capture more _to the right place,_ you'll have more to draw upon in the future – more dots to connect.

If you want to learn more about why we're obsessed with dot-collecting and dot-connecting, watch the first two minutes of this video:

## Not Another Dumping Ground

If you're anything like us, you're already using Notion as your second brain – and perhaps even your team's second brain as well.

You've already got your own custom-build places for notes, articles you want to read later, swipe files of inspiring YouTube thumbnails or UI elements, and more.

But most highlighter and read-it-later apps focus on capturing resources to their own core accounts. When they do let you export to your own tools, the options aren't flexible enough.

Flylighter isn't designed to become yet another account you have to visit to see what you've captured.

We're laser-focused on making the **capture experience** as good as possible.&#x20;

100% of our effort goes to giving you the fastest, most flexible, and most powerful way to capture exactly what you want to send it to the _right place_ in Notion, without any friction.
