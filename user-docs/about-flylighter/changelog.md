_02/19/2025 - v0.11.26_

This release focuses on improving clarity of data filling and improving onboarding. When you first create a new Flow after this update, you‚Äôll be prompted to set your default autofills. Additionally, some tooltips will show up in the Flow Editor when you first open it.

However it‚Äôs not all QoL improvements, we‚Äôve also added an initial set of site specific data. This will be the default tab in the Data Picker when opened on a supported site. The idea behind this section is to pull more customized data from common sites. The first round includes:

* Gmail
* LinkedIn
* YouTube videos

We‚Äôll be expanding the data available for these, and adding new sites regularly! To check out all sites available and the data you can grab, check out [Site Specific Data in the docs](https://docs.flylighter.com/in-depth/site-specific-data).

<details>

<summary>Changes</summary>

* Added indicators of the autofill status to the header of each property
* Simplified data picker navigation
* Data picker now shows all data options by default, with the suggested data for a given property sorted to the top, and a new ‚ÄúSuggested‚Äù badge to go along with it.
* Added the first round of site-specific data.
* Reworked onboarding UX
* Added a prompt on first run to set your autofill defaults.
* Added tutorial tooltips to first Flow open.

_01/08/2025 - v0.11.18_

Hey everyone! Have a very big update for you today. The changes, fixes, and improvements are too many to list, but below is some of the most notable ones. We are gearing up to launch our first suite of paid features, which we‚Äôll have a lot more info to share very soon. While nearly everything currently in Flylighter currently will remain part of the free offering, there are two exceptions:

* You will be limited to single Workspace/Account on the free plan. This will not be applied retroactively though, so any existing connections will continue to work.
* Capture History will be limited to viewing the ten most recent, and append capture limited to the 3 most recent.

As always, please report any bugs you find in ‚Å†bugs, and any ideas or feature requests you have in ‚Å†feedback-ideas, it is tremendously helpful.

<details>

<summary>Changes</summary>

The extension has received redesign to make things less cluttered, more readable, and make better use of the limited space. Let us know what you think!

**General**

* Sidebar mode should now be much improved, allowing you to capture content from multiple pages.
* Added the following options to the extension options page:
* Run Data Recovery \* This is an automated repair process of your user data should you run into an problem that is not being resolved by restarting your browser
* Re-register Context Menus \* If your right-click menu entries disappear, this will bring them back
* Added a plethora of tooltips to various elements.
* Improved opening performance
* Improved performance of the Icon Picker.

**Article capture**

* Article capture now captures image captions as actual image captions in Notion.
* Article capture now supports toggle elements in certain cases.

**Flow Editor**

* Improved the process of initial Flow load. This means less time waiting for things like Relation properties to load.
* You can now minimize sections in the Data Picker (Most useful if you‚Äôre using custom CSS selectors).
* Added validators to properties to indicate when there may be issues (I.E if a URL in URL property might be malformed or invalid).

**Appearance**

* The main menu now uses tabbed navigation.
* Added the full Tabler icon set (>5000 icons). Due to differences in identifiers between the old ones and the new, some Flows may lose their icon.
* Removed the accent color option (sorry to any that enjoyed it ![‚òπÔ∏è](https://discord.com/assets/e4e349c57577f294.svg))
* Replaced the color slider for folder colors to be a fixed set of colors
* Existing folder colors will be set to their closes equivalent\
  The color math for this feature was complex, and performance heavy, and never found the result to be very nice. Perhaps I‚Äôll come back to it down the line.
* Improved the appearance and smoothness of resizing animations of the main popup
* Tightened up all animations

</details>

<details>

<summary>Fixes</summary>

* Fixed numerous issues with article capture, including but not limited to:
  * various instances of image URLs to cause failure
  * Capturing extraneous content such as footers, headers, and links.
* Fixed an issue causing page icons to not appear in Flow
* Fixed renaming a Flow not ‚Äústicking‚Äù when renaming in the Flow list
* Fixed a number of sizing issues causing content to clip or overflow the popup
* Implemented a new drag and drop system in the Flow list and Flow Editor the fixes a number of issues
* Fixes to Flow and Database caching
* Fixed user data downloading
* Fixed tooltips sometimes getting ‚Äúsquished

</details>

_11/05/2024 - v0.11.17_

<details>

<summary>Changes</summary>

* Taking a highlight with either the context menu or keyboard shortcut (`Alt (Win) / Ctrl (Mac) + Shift + S`) now prompts you to choose a Flow, then immediately opens the selected Flow to the content editor
* Changed context menu entries to reduce clicks
* Added various tooltips
* Improved context menu behavior and positioning

</details>

* Fixed some issues where the Flylighter popup would be the incorrect size

This patch brings an overhaul of light mode, and a new design for the Data Picker. We would love everyone's feedback on both of these. Light mode is still a work in progress, so you may still find some areas that are dark mode.

\* Overhauled light mode UI \* Redesigned how data is organized in the Data picker \* Updated ‚ÄúAdd Connection‚Äù button in Settings > Connections to say ‚ÄúAdd/Refresh Connection for clarity. \* Added an image filter to Element Selection when applicable. (e.g. if using the Element selector to pick a page icon, it only highlights/accepts images. \* Allowed the Data Picker to take up more space in the Content Editor \* Added a dedicated way to minimize the Data Picker in the Content Editor

</details>

<details>

<summary>Fixes</summary>

\* Fixed the ‚ÄúRemove Connection‚Äù option in Connection Settings not working. \* Fixed an issue causing Page Capture to not display any pages when choosing a destination. \* Fixed account settings / login not showing up. (P.S. currently there is not much need or reason to create an account unless you‚Äôd like to export your user data) \* Fixed an issue with capturing images with the Element Selector if the image was source was from certain CDNs. \* Fixed an issue where changing the color of select/status/multi-select properties in Notion would cause captures to fail in certain circumstances. \* Enabled scrolling during tutorial to prevent getting stuck on small browser sizes.
