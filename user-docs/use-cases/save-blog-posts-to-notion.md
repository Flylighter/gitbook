# Save Blog Posts to Notion

Here's how to create a flow in Flylighter that will automatically capture the page content when you run it.

This takes advantage of the auto fill data type option in the context menu of blocks you place in the block editor.

Here are the steps at a glance:

1. Create a new flow with any destination and property settings you want.
2. Navigate to the Content tab.
3. Select the article chip from the Basic Data plugin.
4. Click the context menu on the Article block in the Content Editor.
5. Choose **Autofill Data Type.**

That's it. Now, whenever you run this flow, it will capture the detected article on the page, along with any property values that you've chosen or are autofilling.
