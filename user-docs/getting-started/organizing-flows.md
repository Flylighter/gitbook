## Folders, Colors, & Icons

**Flows** can be organized into folders and given icons. To create a new folder, click the **New** dropdown in the top left. Additionally folders can also be given a color to help quickly identify things at a glance by clicking the folder icon. Flows can be given icons by clicking on the icon.

&#x20;Folders and Flows can be organized by dragging and dropping. Individual folders can be sorted in four ways: alphabetical, date created, last used, capture count, and manually.

More options for Flows and folders can be accessed by right clicking them, or by clicking the 3-dot handle next to them. Here you can do things like add to favorites, rename, and delete them.

## Ordering & Hiding Properties

Properties in flows can be rearranged by dragging by the handle above them. They can be hidden & unhidden by clicking the eye icon to the right. Future Flows you create will remember the last order you used for the same database.
