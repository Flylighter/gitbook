# Organizing Flows

**Flows** are organized into folders. **Flows** without a folder will be put in an auto-generated folder titled **No Folder**. This folder cannot be recolored or moved.

## Creating Flows & Folders

To create a new Flow or folder there are two buttons in the bottom left. Alternatively, you can automatically set the new Flows folder by using the **+** button on the folder which is revealed when hovering it.\
\
Inside the Flow creation modal you can set the icon, name, [capture mode](../in-depth/capture-modes.md), and folder.

## Folder colors & Flow icons

Folders can be given a color by clicking the folder icon. You can change a Flows icon by clicking on it.

## Sorting & Arranging

Individual folders can be sorted in four ways: A**lphabetical**, **Date Created**, **Last Used**, **Capture Count**, and **Manual**.

Folders and Flows can be reordered or moved between folders by dragging and dropping. Drag and drop will automatically set a Folders sort to **Manual.**

More options for Flows and folders can be accessed by right clicking them, or by clicking the 3-dot handle next to them. Here you can do things like add to favorites, rename, and delete them.
