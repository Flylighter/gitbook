2. Click the Flow

...or in one keyboard shortcut. 

*Visit [Keyboard Shortcuts](../settings/shortcuts.md) for more info on setting keyboard shortcuts.*

You can enable Instant Capture on any Flow by going to the **Settings** tab in the Flow Editor, and toggling the **Instant Capture** switch.

## Set a Keyboard Shortcut

Two clicks still too slow for you?

In the Settings under the [Keyboard Shortcuts](../settings/shortcuts.md) tab, you can set a keyboard shortcut for any Flow.

Combined with Instant Capture, this will let you instantly capture any web page to your Flow using your keyboard shortcut!
