# Set Up Instant Capture

The more you get going with Flylighter, the faster it gets at capturing the information you need. After you have your favorite **Flows** set up with [autofilling properties](auto-filling-flows.md), you can make things even faster with **Instant Capture**.

**Instant Capture** is exactly what it sounds like: instead of needing to open up Flylighter, select your **Flow**, and then fill things out before capturing a page to Notion, you'll be able to simply choose your **Flow** and let Flylighter handle the rest.

Specifically, this will get you down to either two mouse clicks (open Flylighter → select **Flow**) or _one_ [**Keyboard Shortcut**](../settings/shortcuts.md).

This is _perfect_ for things like a _Read Later_ **Flow**, where the entire point is that you don't have time to process this information right now.

### Enable Instant Capture for a Flow

There are two ways to enable **Instant Capture** for any given **Flow**.

#### In a Flow's Settings Tab

Click on the **Settings** tab for any **Flow** and you'll find a toggle right near the top for changing the **Autofill** setting.

#### Via the Right-Click Menu in the Flow List

If you'd rather save a click, you can right-click any **Flow** from the main Flylighter window and click **Enable Instant Capture** instead.

In either case, afterward, you'll see a ⚡️ symbol next to the Flow's name.

### Set Up a Keyboard Shortcut

If you want to hit maximum capture speed, you might want to set up a [**Keyboard Shortcut**](../settings/shortcuts.md).

When you do this, it's on a per-**Flow** basis—for example, you might set up a _Read Later_ **Flow** with ^+Shift+R, but an _Inspiration_ **Flow** with ^+Shift+I. You can set up as many **Instant Capture** **Flows** as you can find new keyboard combinations for!
