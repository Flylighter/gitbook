# Authenticating Notion

Whether you chose to do the interactive tutorial, or skipped it, the next step will be to add a Notion workspace.

Using the template is designed to be used with the interactive tutorial, so if you're following along here, go ahead and choose "Select pages to share with Flylighter".

Choose the pages you wish to give Flylighter access to. You can always update these permissions later.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't already have your own note-taking setup in Notion, you can use my free [Ultimate Notes](https://thomasfrank.notion.site/Ultimate-Notes-615417469d764e4c8136944371f21da1?pvs=4) template, which is similar to Ultimate Brain's notes dashboard.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** If you give Flylighter access to a lot of databases, it can take a while to index them when you're setting up your first Flow. We're working on improving the performance of this process, but you can speed it up yourself by hand-picking only a few databases or pages.
{% endhint %}

Once you've connected your Notion account, you can [create your first Flow](create-your-first-flow.md). (Alternatively, you can [watch our tutorial videos](watch-the-tutorials.md))

Flows are what you'll use to quickly capture web pages, articles, highlights, and more to Notion.
