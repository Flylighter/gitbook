# Authenticating Notion

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't already have your own note-taking setup in Notion, you can use my free [Ultimate Notes](https://thomasfrank.notion.site/Ultimate-Notes-615417469d764e4c8136944371f21da1?pvs=4) template, which is similar to Ultimate Brain's notes dashboard.

**Note:** If you give Flylighter access to a lot of databases, it can take a while to index them when you're setting up your first Flow. We're working on improving the performance of this process, but you can speed it up yourself by hand-picking only a few databases or pages.
{% endhint %}

Once you've connected your Notion account, you can [create your first Flow](create-your-first-flow.md). (Alternatively, you can [watch our tutorial videos](watch-the-tutorials.md))

Flows are what you'll use to quickly capture web pages, articles, highlights, and more to Notion.
