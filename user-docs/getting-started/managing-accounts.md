_This page is under construction, and may have screenshots from a previous version of our UI._
{% endhint %}

You can manage your connected accounts in the main extension settings under the "Connections".

{% hint style="info" %}
The Free plan is limited to adding one connection. Upgrading to [Insiders](../insiders-features/overview.md) gives you access to unlimited connections.
{% endhint %}

## Adding Accounts

To add an account (or Notion Workspace) click the **+ Refrsh/add a connection** button. This will take you to a login flow similar to when you initially set up the extension.

{% hint style="info" %}
Adding and account or workspace that is already connected will update the page permissions for that account.
{% endhint %}

You can delete an account by clicking the **Remove Connection** button.
