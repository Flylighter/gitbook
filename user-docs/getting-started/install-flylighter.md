# Install Flylighter

Flylighter is a browser extension available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/u/6/detail/flylighter/dlmdffmkcggiicjbfnjcnikkpahgplmd) and the [Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flylighter-beta/) directory.

It lives up in your web browser's toolbar, where you can click it to easily run any of your Flows and capture any information on the page you're visiting.

Flylighter is compatible with any Chromium or Firefox-based web browser, including:

* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Microsoft Edge (Thomas's pick)
* Zen (Eli's pick)
* Arc
* Brave
* Opera

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Firefox extensions don't have as many capabilities as Chrome extensions do, so certain features available in Chrome-based browsers won't be available on Firefox or Zen.
{% endhint %}

## Install the Extension

You can find and install Flylighter directly from the Chrome Web Store, or via the Firefox Add-Ons direcotry (beta):
