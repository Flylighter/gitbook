## Adding Accounts

To add an account (or Notion Workspace) click the **+ Account** button. This will take you to a login flow similar to when you initially set up the extension.

{% hint style="info" %}
Adding and account or workspace that is already connected will update the page permissions for that account.
{% endhint %}

You can delete an account by clicking the trash icon next to an account.

## Default Account

The **Default Account** option sets the account that is automatically selected when creating a new **Flow**.
